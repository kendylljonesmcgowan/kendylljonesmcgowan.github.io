<!-- here is my main page content "About Me" -->

<h1>Welcome! My name is Kendyll Jones-McGowan.</h1>

<!-- here I introduce myself and provide some background information -->

<p>I am a student, currently studying at Fleming College. 
This website is all about my map making journey in post secondary - enjoy!</p>

<p> I am a graduate of Fleming College's Ecosystem Management Technician (EM) program. 
I completed the program in 2021, but wasn't quite finished with school at that point. 
During my time in the EM program, I had the opportunity to take three GIS related courses.
Through these courses I discovered a deep passion for the GIS field. Before these courses, 
I had never experienced such passion for any subject. Right away I knew this was the career 
I desperately wanted to see myself in. I applied to Fleming College's GIS Post-Graduate program 
 - which is where I find myself currently.</p>
